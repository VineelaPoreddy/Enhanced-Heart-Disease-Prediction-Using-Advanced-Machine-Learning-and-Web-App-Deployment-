Enhanced Heart Disease Prediction using Advanced Machine Learning and Web App Deployment

Overview

Heart disease remains a leading cause of death worldwide, necessitating the development of accurate and interpretable predictive models to aid early diagnosis and preventive care. This project aims to enhance the accuracy and usability of heart disease prediction models by integrating advanced machine learning techniques, feature engineering, and comprehensive model evaluation.

Features

Advanced Machine Learning Models: Implements Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, Na√Øve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and ensemble learning methods such as Voting Classifier.

Feature Engineering: Incorporates additional features like BMI, smoking status, diet, and stress levels for improved prediction accuracy.

Addressing Class Imbalance: Uses SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance datasets and enhance performance.

Model Interpretability: Integrates SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to provide transparency in model predictions.

Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics: Utilizes Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation and metrics such as ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-score to ensure robust performance.

Web Deployment: Develops a user-friendly web application using Flask for real-time heart disease prediction.

Performance Monitoring: Implements continuous learning and model monitoring to maintain long-term scalability and reliability.
